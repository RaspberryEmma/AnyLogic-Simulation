# AnyLogic-Simulation
Simulation of an NHS-adjacent healthcare service, seeking to manage and minimise waiting times for incoming patients of several types.  Produced in collaboration with Oliver Rees and Emma Tarmey.

In this simulation we consider:
 - 2 Varieties of patient types
 - Random arrival times
 - A number of performance metrics
 - Existing wait times prior to entering the system

Conducted as part of the coursework for my current ongoing master's programme.
